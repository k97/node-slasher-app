        <p className="measure lh-copy">I am Karthikeyan Rajendran, an Indian expat who is a part designer and part coder. I have been tinkering with web ever since I started using it. If I am awestruck by an webpage, my developer tools will follow suit and dissect each and every pixels of it, right from the aesthetics to the technical awesomeness that my mind can boggle.
        </p>
        <p className="measure lh-copy">
          My other passions are cars and any beautifully designed product. Right now, I am an surviving the scorching heat of  Dubai, while pushing code that keeps the Emirates aircrafts aflight.
